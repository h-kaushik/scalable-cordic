# Scalable Cordic
This repository contains Verilog description for Cordic algorithm to calculate "arctan(y/x)".
By scalable, it is intended that additional "depth" to the cordic algorithm can be provided by addition of new angles to the "scaled_angles.hex" file. Also, minor changes need to be done to the number of counter bits.
